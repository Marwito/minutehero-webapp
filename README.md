MinuteHero WWW
================
These instructions should work on Ubuntu 14 and 16.

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.3.3
- Rails 5.0.1

Setting up the development environment
--------------------------------------

### Install RVM

* \curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/stable/binscripts/rvm-installer | sudo bash -s stable
* source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm # to be added to .bashrc
* type rvm | head -n 1 # to confirm that rvm is loaded as a function. It should
  output "rvm is a function". If it shows anything else, rvm isn't loading
  correctly.
* rvm install 2.3.3

* sudo usermod -a -G rvm $USER

### Install NVM

* sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
* sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
* curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash
* nvm install 6.0

### Install bower

* sudo npm install -g bower

### Install bundler

* gem install bundler
* bundle install

### Install Postgres on Ubuntu 14.04

* for other Ubuntu versions :
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/831292/how-to-install-postgresql-9-6-on-any-ubuntu-version

* sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/
  trusty-pgdg main"
* wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo
  apt-key add -
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.6
* sudo apt install libpq-dev
* sudo -u postgres psql 
* \password # to change your password
* Enter new password: # type postgres
* Enter it again: # confirmation
* \q # to quit psql

In case postgres wouldn't start, execute these commands :

* systemctl status postgresql # If PostgreSQL is running, you'll see output that
  includes the text Active: active (exited).
  If you see Active: inactive (dead), start the PostgreSQL service using the
  following command:

* systemctl start postgresql

PostgreSQL also needs to be enabled to start on reboot. Do that with this
command:

* systemctl enable postgresql

### Install phantomjs

* sudo apt install phantomjs # Needed to run the automated regression tests
  using rspec

### Email notification configuration

We use AWS SES to receive email notifications from the app.

1. Install AWS SDK for Ruby : gem install aws-sdk

2. Get your AWS credentials and save them respectively in the variables:
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in the file
   'config/application.yml'

3. You can edit the email addresses you want to receive notifications for using
   the variable 'send_call_notifications_to_email' in the file
   'config/application.yml' too. 

4. Verify these email addresses with Amazon SES.

### Setup of the database

* rake db:drop # only if you already have an existing database
* rake db:create
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:seed

### Starting the web server by default

* guard

### Admin account by default:

* admin_email: admin@minutehero.net
* admin_password: minher0!

Running Unit Tests
------------------

    $ rspec

You need [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) to run the tests.

Development Workflow
--------------------

1. Create a new branch for each new bug fix or feature:

       $ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

2. Commit your local changes to the local repository. Several commits are fine.
   Use `gitk` and `git-gui` or just

       $ git commit -m "feat: Notifications are sent to ..."

   Use
   [Semantic Commit Messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).


3. Regularly push your changes to the remote branch with the same name as your
   local branch.

       $ git push

4. When you're ready for a code review, issue a pull request for your branch
   on GitHub.

5. Wait for the feedback of the reviewer. If changes need to be made, go back to
   step 2, otherwise the reviewer has accepted your changes and you can move on
   to the next step.

6. Merge your changes into the branch 'staging'

       $ git checkout staging
       $ git merge [name_of_your_new_branch]

7. Push your changes to the remote staging branch.

       $ git push

8. Deploy on staging.minutehero.net.

       $ cap staging deploy

9. Let the business people test your changes on staging.minutehero.net. If there
   are issues, go back to step 2. Otherwise go to the next step.

10. Tell Marc P端ls that the bug fix or feature is ready for deployment on
    production.

11. Marc P端ls: Merge branch 'staging' into 'master'

        $ git pull
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge staging
        $ git push

12. Marc P端ls: Deploy on production

        $ cap production deploy

Deploying
---------

We use Capistrano to deploy releases.

We have two instances of this web application:

1. my.minutehero.net (production)
2. staging.minutehero.net (staging)

which run on separate VMs on AWS. To be able to deploy, your public SSH key must
be in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the respective VM. Ask Marc P端ls to put it
there.
